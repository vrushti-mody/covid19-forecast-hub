methods_long: The Political Realities Model (PRM) is built on observations of macro-level
  societal and political responses to COVID19 characterized only in terms of infections
  and deaths. The starting point of the model is the hypothesis that although individuals
  and policy makers have responded to the epidemic with a wide variety of behavioral
  modifications and policy actions, the actual net impact of the measures taken, though
  not identical across time or geography, is predictable. Moreover, these predictions
  can be based upon what a society and its elected officials have demonstrated it
  (they) will accept as a reasonable aggregate impact from COVID19. This model seeks
  to identify one or more "acceptability" range(s) from observation of the epidemic
  up to the current time and to understand how much impact on infection rates is achieved
  by responses in this (these) range(s). Deaths, in turn, are related to infections
  via a simple (time- and geographically-varying) phenomenological model derived through
  fitting. This allows the model to build in spatiotemporal variation in the demographics
  of the population, its access to health care & COVID testing, and the actual infection
  fatality rate without explicitly considering these factors. At present the model
  is deterministic rather than probabilistic, and so only provides point forecasts.
  The model considers the United States at the state level.
